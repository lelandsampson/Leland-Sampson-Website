## Why You Need Insurance
While businesses often offer health insurance, those standard plans often don't cover everything life throws at your team. Supplemental insurance is an excellent way to fill those financial gaps, ensuring your employees have an easier time covering unexpected bills while bolstering the overall benefits package you offer. By providing this extra layer of security, you show your staff that you truly care about their well-being.

Offering a robust benefits package is also a powerful tool for recruiting top talent and keeping your best employees happy and loyal. Since employer contributions are completely optional, you can provide these valuable perks without necessarily increasing your budget. Plus, there are practical advantages for everyone: deductions are often taken pre-tax to reduce your company's overall FICA costs and lower your employee's taxable income.

## Coverage Options
There are many different types of insurance available to cover the wide variety of situations your employees might face. Examples of supplemental insurance include:

* **Short-term disability coverage**
* **Accident insurance**
* **Specified life event insurance**
* **Cancer insurance**
* **Hospital indemnity**
* **Juvenile life insurance**
* **Dental insurance**
* **Vision insurance**

We understand that general health insurance can't catch every curveball, which is why these products are designed to handle specific risks. From maintaining healthy smiles with dental coverage to providing critical financial support during a serious illness, these options provide a comprehensive safety net. I can help you select the perfect mix of products that makes the most sense for your specific team.

## Consultation Process
My process begins with a relaxed conversation with you to conduct a holistic review of your employee needs based on your specific industry. We assess the coverage you currently have in place so we can find the right options to perfectly complement your existing benefits. We know you are busy, so we are happy to meet wherever is most convenient for you, whether that is in your office, over the phone, or via video conference.

Once we have a solid plan for the business, the next step is to meet 1-1 with each employee to help them select the insurance they need. I strictly avoid pressure tactics; instead, I let your employee's best interest guide every piece of advice I give. I look forward to building a long-term relationship with your team, including annual review visits to ensure everyone’s coverage remains up to date as their lives evolve.
