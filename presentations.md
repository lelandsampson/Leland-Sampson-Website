### Resistance Is NOT Futile: Strategies for Integrating a Critical AI Perspective in Libraries
**2025 American Association of Law Librarians Annual Meeting**  
The rapid integration of AI in legal practice, government, and academia raises significant ethical and practical concerns for librarians and information professionals, including impacts on misinformation, critical thinking, the environment, and labor displacement. These issues are often overlooked in AI education, but as experts in information management and procurement, librarians are uniquely positioned to critically evaluate these tools, advocate for responsible use, and shape AI's role within their institutions. This program will equip law librarians and legal educators to integrate these crucial ethical considerations into AI teaching, evaluation, and implementation, fostering a more thoughtful approach to AI adoption.

### Tech to Make You More Efficient: Leveraging Mainstream Al tools in Your Organization or Practice
**2025 MSBA Legal Summit and Annual Meeting**  
This session gave attendees practical insights into how widely available AI and other technology tools could significantly boost productivity in law practice or other business contexts. Building upon the foundational knowledge shared in last year's session, we introduced more advanced tools and use cases for modestly priced AI tools from OpenAI, Microsoft, Zoom, and others. The session focused on cost-effective solutions and efficiency hacks. We walked participants through real-world examples, including public chatbots, the development of GPT models, and the use of AI for automating workflows. Key topics included public chatbots and their practical applications, mainstream AI productivity tools, the use of ChatGPT for coding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and data visualization through AI.

### Practical AI and Automation Tools for Maryland Legal Nonprofits
**2025 Partners for Justice Conference**  
We shared a spectrum of reasonably safe and trustworthy generative AI and automation tools and techniques that small organizations with little or no technical support could implement easily or with help from within the community. First, we looked at a few of the major commercial off-the-shelf tools for office efficiency and provided a cookbook approach to developing our own solutions. Then we explored a few bigger AI and automation projects underway in Maryland and thought about how they could directly benefit the community and provide models for further development. Finally, we looked at elements that went into an AI Use Policy and gave participants some insights on balancing usefulness and information safety.

### Finding Maryland Legal Forms
**2023 MLA/DLA Conference**  
A patron walks up to the information desk and says, “I need a form to file with the court so they’ll review my case,” or “My ex got a new job with more money, how do I find a form to get my child support changed?” Do you get questions like these? Confused about what to tell the patron and what information to give them? Some legal actions in Maryland have official forms, but many do not. This can make figuring out what to give your patron a challenge. This session provided an overview of what might be considered a form, where to find forms, where to find guidance for people trying to fill out or construct a form, and much more.
