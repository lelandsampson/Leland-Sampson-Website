### Finding Maryland Legal Forms
**2023 MLA/DLA Conference**  
A patron walks up to the information desk and says, “I need a form to file with the court so they’ll review my case,” or “My ex got a new job with more money, how do I find a form to get my child support changed?” Do you get questions like these? Confused about what to tell the patron and what information to give them? Some legal actions in Maryland have official forms, but many do not. This can make figuring out what to give your patron a challenge. This session provided an overview of what might be considered a form, where to find forms, where to find guidance for people trying to fill out or construct a form, and much more.
