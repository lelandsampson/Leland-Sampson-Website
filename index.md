# Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Leland Sampson, an attorney and director of the People's Law Library - a free online legal information site designed to make the law accessible through plain language explanations of common legal issues. This site contains my biographical information and links to recent speaking engagements.
