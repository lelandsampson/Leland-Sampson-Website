A new set of tools can help you quickly develop both the form and content of written materials, analyze text, and translate back and forth between sounds, pictures, and text. With a significant focus on basic, inexpensive AI tools, this presentation will highlight practical technology tips and tools to save working time, increase your data security, and provide a better level of service.

- **Introduction to using generative AI**
  - **Definition**: Computers performing tasks that normally require human intelligence
    - Visual perceptionâ€‹
    - Speech recognitionâ€‹
    - Decision-makingâ€‹
    - Translation between languagesâ€‹
    - Pattern recognition and providing plausible responses to freeform questions

  - **How to conceptualize AI tools**
    - **Beside**: AI tools are separate programs or websites. You give it some context and a prompt and do something with the output.
      - *Example*: uploading a PDF to Claude and asking it questions about the content of a PDF. Or using ChatGPT to write an email draft that you then copy and paste into your email app.
    - **Inside**: Apps have AI tools built in.
      - *Example*: Microsoft Copilot in Word suggesting ways to rewrite a paragraph or generate a first draft.
    - **Outside**: AI is your assistant. You give the AI a task, and the AI selects the app to use, performs the task, and reports back on the outcome.
      - *Example*: none exist yet.
