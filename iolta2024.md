IOLTA Conference</h2>

## [Presentation Slides](files/2024_IOLTA_Conference_Tech_to_make_you_more_efficient.pdf)

Building on their well-received presentation at the 2023 Conference, Lee and Dave will share additional information on practical ways that IOLTA funders can use new AI tools and other tech in their offices. The presentation will highlight a variety of options, but will pause to go deeper with key tools, sharing specific use cases, and facilitating some audience conversation to get the juices flowing for how ideas can be taken home and put to work, improving efficiency and ease. The goal is for participants to leave with new tools to consider and greater confidence in managing their own technology solutions.

**Key Takeaway:** "When you're already good at something, and you're knowledgeable in a particular field, this is when AI helps you shine. Augmenting your existing abilities with it is the best way to go. Don't try to do something that you don't know how to do already with it." - Russ Bloomquist, Maryland Legal Aid
